## Abstract

Humans exhibit incredibly high levels of multi-modal understanding - combining visual cues with read, or heard knowledge comes easy to us and allows for very accurate interaction with the surrounding environment. Various simulation environments focus on providing data for tasks related to scene understanding, question answering, space exploration, visual navigation. In this work, we are providing a solution to encompass both, visual and behavioural aspects of simulation in a new environment for learning interactive reasoning in manipulation setup. SAMPLE-HD environment allows to generate various scenes composed of small household objects, to procedurally generate language instructions for manipulation, and to generate ground truth paths serving as training data.
