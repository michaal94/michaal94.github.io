## Abstract

In this article, we present a proposition of the methodology of the robotised part replication, designed to be implemented according to Industry 4.0 paradigm. The replication process relies on a digital model which establishes the base for robotised 3D scanning, the preparation of the CAD model and robotised milling. The main goal of the article was to estimate errors that potentially may occur in predefined key stages of the proposed approach. We present the results of analysing the errors arising from numerical controlled machining of the representative part â€“ from collecting the digital point cloud model to a computer simulation of the machining process based on the CAD model. The article also contains propositions for future work in robotised part replication.
